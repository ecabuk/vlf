## Abstract
A modern low-cost microcomputer and accessories were used to create a VLF receiver for geophysical prospecting. The signals are detected by induction coils, amplified, digitized by a sound card and analyzed by a Raspberry Pi computer, which uses a Linux operating system and the Python programming language. The peripheral devices were commercial “off-the-shelf”’ items except for the preamplifiers and the induction coils which were designed and constructed by authors EC and GB. A test profile shows typical VLF anomalies across a weak conductor.
